### What is 'tree-shaking'?

Tree-shaking a.k.a. 'live code inclusion' is the process of only including the code that is used.  It is similar to dead code elimination but can be more efficient.

### Why are ES2015 modules better than AMD and CommonJS?

ES2015 modules are an official standard that will be arriving soon to browsers and Node.js. They allow static analysis that enables optimizations like tree-shaking, and have advanced features like circular references and live bindings.
