### Why are ES modules better than CommonJS modules?

ES modules are an official standard and the clear path forward for JavaScript code structure, whereas CommonJS modules are an idiosyncratic legacy format that served as a stopgap solution before ES modules had been proposed. ES modules allow static analysis that enables optimizations like tree-shaking, and provide advanced features like circular references and live bindings.

### What is "tree-shaking?"

Tree-shaking, also known as "live code inclusion," is the process of only including code that is actually run by a given project. It is [similar to dead code elimination](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/tree-shaking-versus-dead-code-elimination-d3765df85c80#.jnypozs9n) but can be much more efficient.
